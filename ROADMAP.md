# Road Map - WORK IN PROGRESS

Here is a list, by category, of the desired scripts for all Godot Engine users to incorporate and enjoy. Each category is broken down into basic, intermediate, and advanced per the Game Accessibility Guidelines site that we use in the game jame. You can find the full checklist here. If you have a better resource, or format suggestion, please let us know. We are aware that not every use case will apply to all games. Each task listed below links to the example from the Game Accessibility Guidelines website. The second link goes to the issue it is tied to on the repo.

# Motor 

## Basic ##

1. Allows controls be remapped/reconfigured
2. Ensure controls are as simple as possible, or provide a simpler alternative.
3. Ensure that all areas of the user interface can be accessed using the same input method as the gameplay
4. Include an option to adjust the sensitive of controls
5. Ensure interactive elements/virtual controls are large and well spaced
6. Include toggle/slider for any haptics

## Intermediate ##

1. Support more than one input device
2. Make interactive elements that require accuracy (eg. cursor/touch controlled menu options) stationary
3. Ensure that multiple simultaneous actions (eg. click/drag or swipe) are not required, and included only as a supplementary / alternative input method
4. Ensure that all key actions can be carried out by digital controls (pad / keys / presses), with more complex input (eg. analogue, speech, gesture) not required, and included only as supplementary / alternative input methods
5. Include an option to adjust the game speed
6. Avoid repeated inputs (button-mashing/quick time events)
7. If producing a PC game, support windowed mode for compatibility with overlaid virtual keyboards
8. Avoid / provide alternatives to requiring buttons to be held down
9. Allow interfaces to be rearranged
10. Allow interfaces to be resized
11. Provide a macro system
12. Do not rely on motion tracking of specific body types

## Advanced ##

1. Allow play in both portrait and landscape
2. Do not make precise timing essential to gameplay â€“ offer alternatives, actions that can be carried out while paused, or a skip mechanism
3. Include a cool-down period (post acceptance delay) of 0.5 seconds between inputs
4. Provide very simple control schemes that are compatible with assistive technology devices, such as switch or eye tracking
