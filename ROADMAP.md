# Road Map 

Here is a list, by category, of the desired scripts for all Godot Engine users to incorporate and enjoy. Each category is broken down into basic, intermediate, and advanced per the Game Accessibility Guidelines site that we use in the game jame. If you have a better resource, or format suggestion, please let us know. We are aware that not every use case will apply to all games. Each task listed below links to the example from the Game Accessibility Guidelines website. The second link goes to the issue it is tied to on the repo.
