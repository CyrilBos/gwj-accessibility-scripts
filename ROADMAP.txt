Road Map

Here is a list, by category, of the desired scripts for all Godot Engine users to incorporate and enjoy. Each category is broken down into basic, intermediate, and advanced per the Game Accessibility Guidelines site that we use in the game jame. If you have a better resource, or format suggestion, please let us know. We are aware that not every use case will apply to all games. Each task listed below links to the example from the Game Accessibility Guidelines website. The second link goes to the issue it is tied to on the repo.

# Motor #

## Basic ##

- [] Allows controls be remapped/reconfigured
- [] Ensure controls are as simple as possible, or provide a simpler alternative.
- [] Ensure that all areas of the user interface can be accessed using the same input method as the gameplay
- [] Include an option to adjust the sensitive of controls
- [] Ensure interactive elements/virtual controls are large and well spaced
- [] Include toggle/slider for any haptics

## Intermediates ##

- [] Support more than one input device
- [] Make interactive elements that require accuracy (eg. cursor/touch controlled menu options) stationary
- [] Ensure that multiple simultaneous actions (eg. click/drag or swipe) are not required and included only as a supplementary/alternative method
